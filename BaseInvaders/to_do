2. Game "Main Menu" Screen with options to pick your character
3. Add Biology notes to the pre-game when a player clicks START to make it more educational (talk about PCR)
4. Scoreboard (how much score you have) somewhere on the screen
5. End the game if time runs out before you get the needed base
6. Add levels based on the # of bases you have paired which get harder per level
7. Show level count as background text under the main "Base Invaders" title in a matching blue
8. Add evil mob to game that kills players and ends the game
9. Add an end game screen
11. Make a loading screen for resources (seriously, lol) -- change characters to import DURING GAME loading screen as a loading screen process
    a) Don't forget we need to support more than one game so make sure the loading screen is under base invaders & not main\

go thru all models and assign an offset for bounding box
change the timer's colour when it gets close to being out of time
change the timer angle calculation to be based off of time left instead of +='ing the angle (good luck doing the math future isaac lmao)
add a "slide" mechanism for when you let go of the key
load all fonts from a file instead of the system
12. Dummy event handling for loading screen to stop blue loading wheel from appearing
